This is a rather short python 2 script that searches through the XML
file of an exported keepassx database and searches for a password hash.
Might be useful in case one of your account's passwords is leaked by hackers, but
you don't know what account it belongs to.

This binary requires the defusedxml version 0.4.1 python egg from pypi. You can probably easily
make it work with other readily available xml parsers for python.
